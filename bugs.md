## CRIT

### B1 — CANCEL_REQUESTED → RUNNING resurrection of a *cancelled destructive* task  ·  FIX-W1
`confirm.py:191`, `state.py:216`/`201`. Destructive submit → PENDING_CONFIRMATION + `_staged`. "отмени" → `request_cancel` flips store to CANCEL_REQUESTED but **never clears ConfirmFlow `_staged`**. Later "да" → `confirm("confirm")` → `_staged` still live, not timed out → `set_task_status(RUNNING)`; terminal guard covers only COMPLETED/FAILED → CANCEL_REQUESTED silently → RUNNING → `on_task_committed` **launches the destructive task the user cancelled.** Fix: `request_cancel`/cancel must clear the staged confirm; and/or `confirm` must refuse when status is CANCEL_REQUESTED.

### B11 — Grep/Glob content-scan reads in-workspace secret CONTENTS (gate sees only the path arg)  ·  known (slice-4 residual, no-exfil backstop)
`kora.py:383-385`,`400-404`. `Grep(pattern=".", path=workspace, output_mode=content)` recurses into `workspace/.env` etc. and returns their lines; the gate only checks the `path` arg (the dir → allowed). Documented in slice-4 parking lot: backstopped by NO-EXFIL (egress denied + completion-SPEAK templated from task_text, not Кора output + dispatcher sees only redacted [СОСТОЯНИЕ]/is_error) — the secret is trapped in Кора's ephemeral session. Full fix (output post-filter / deny broad content-grep) = M1.1; do NOT cripple Кора's search in v1.

## MAJOR

### B2 — `monitor_forever` dies permanently on any loop-body exception (silent)  ·  FIX-W1
`app.py:135-140`, launched `webrtc_server.py:86`. Unguarded `while True`; `journal.alert`→`os.fsync` OSError propagates → loop ends → `speak_ledger.check()` (the SOLE voice-path driver of Р-15г CRITICAL_WITHOUT_SPEAK, §8 крит.5) stops for the session. Task is a bare `ensure_future` only `.cancel()`d in finally → exception never retrieved, death silent. Fix: try/except(Exception, log/alert)+continue in the loop body, re-raise CancelledError.

### B3 — `apply_event` has no terminal guard → COMPLETED overwritten by a later FAILED/RUNNING  ·  FIX-W1
`state.py:230-238`. Sets `status=new_status` for any lifecycle event with no terminal check (unlike `set_task_status` at :201). A 2nd `ResultMessage`, or `task_failed` after `task_completed` (stream loop has no break), or a late `SystemMessage(init)` → wrong terminal reported to user. Fix: guard against overwriting COMPLETED/FAILED in `apply_event`.

### B4 — `config.from_env` unguarded `int()/float()` crashes the whole app on a malformed env value  ·  FIX-W1
`config.py:110-115`. `KORA_MAX_TURNS=forty` (or budget/deadline typo) → ValueError takes down `from_env()` instead of falling back to the default. Fix: guarded parse → keep dataclass default on ValueError (+ optionally log).

### B5 — Tool dispatch by `getattr` bypasses the `ALL_SCHEMAS` allowlist  ·  FIX-W1
`loop.py:90` (`getattr(self._handlers, call.name)`) + `:53`. A hallucinated/adversarial tool name colliding with a real method (`begin_turn`) invokes that method / crashes on arg-mismatch, mutating turn state. Fix: validate `call.name` against the ALL_SCHEMAS name-set before dispatch; unknown → error result.

### B6 — Prompt anchor-insertion silently no-ops if `PROMPT_V3` wording drifts → OWED safety rules vanish  ·  FIX-W1
`prompt.py:52-81`. `_apply_owed_additions` inserts rules 7/8/9 + possibilities г/д via exact `str.replace` on verbatim anchors. Any edit to `PROMPT_V3` makes a `replace` a silent no-op — safety rules dropped, `include_owed_prompt_rules` still True, no error. Fix: assert each replace changed the string (raise on missing anchor).

### B7 — Kora SDK subprocess not torn down on WebRTC disconnect  ·  REJECTED (by design)
`webrtc_server.py:65-74` disconnect cancels only the pipeline task, not Kora. Senior review: this is INTENDED — §2.7/slice-0 requires "task survives a reconnect (drop tab → reconnect → same task)". Cancelling Kora on disconnect terminalizes the logical task to FAILED and breaks that v1 DoD. Orphaned budget is bounded (`kora_deadline_s` + `max_budget_usd`); a grace-based cancel-if-no-reconnect is M1.1 (needs reconnect-reattach). Test removed.

### B8 — `active_sessions` grows unbounded (bare `/start` never popped)  ·  FIX-W1
`webrtc_server.py:117` create, `:95-96` only pop (in `run_session` finally, reached only via a completed offer). A `/start` with no follow-up offer (tab closed, ICE fail, retry, curl loop) leaks forever; value is attacker-sized JSON. Fix: cap/TTL/evict, or pop on offer-consumed; drop the structure if only readiness is needed.

### B9 — `speak()` fire-and-forget `ensure_future` swallows exceptions + drops the SPEAK  ·  FIX-W1
`app.py:120`,`128`. Ledger marked spoken FIRST (line 120), then `ensure_future(push_speak_frame)` with no ref/done-callback. If `queue_frame` raises (teardown/cancel), exception never retrieved AND — because the ledger says spoken — CRITICAL_WITHOUT_SPEAK can never fire for the lost critical. Fix: attach a done-callback that logs/alerts on failure (and reconsider marking spoken before emit).

### B10 — Dispatcher tool loop discards second-pass tool_calls  ·  carry
`loop.py:69`. Strictly 2-pass: `text, _ = await self._complete()` drops any pass-2 tool_calls (a real LLM chaining get_task_status→request_cancel loses the follow-up silently). Fix: loop until no tool_calls or a bounded max.

### B12 — Р-11 between-turns liveness is decorative: `monitor_forever` discards `liveness()` and no stale/unreachable alert exists  ·  carry
`app.py:140`, `state.py:240-253`. `liveness()` is a pure query; its result is thrown away and there is NO AlertKind/SPEAK for STALE/UNREACHABLE anywhere. A Kora that dies between turns emits nothing until the LLM next renders [СОСТОЯНИЕ]. Fix: emit an alert (and/or proactive SPEAK) when liveness degrades in the monitor.

### B13 — `journal.begin_turn` never called in the voice path → tool calls unrecorded + `check_grounding` never runs in production  ·  carry
`app.py:265-268`, `journal.py:90-91`, `loop.py:52`. Only DispatcherTurnLoop/console calls `begin_turn`; the pipecat STT `on_end_of_turn` only calls `note_user_turn`. So `_current=None` in voice: `record_tool_call` no-ops, STATUS_WITHOUT_GROUNDING (§8 крит.5) can never fire live. Also makes the R1 dedup latch inert in voice (B14). Fix: wire begin_turn/end_turn/check_grounding into the voice tool path.

### B15 — Arbiter `_drain()` on every TextFrame defeats SPEAK preemption + `flush_dispatcher`  ·  carry (needs verification vs slice-2 push design)
`arbiter.py:104-113`. `_drain` empties the queue after each frame → a later Kora `TTSSpeakFrame` sees an empty queue, so drop-tail/`flush_dispatcher` (`:70-79`) never engages; SPEAK lands behind already-flushed dispatcher sentences. Verify against the slice-2 direct-inject design (which bypasses the queue) before fixing — may be moot on the live push path.

### B16 — WebRTC signaling has zero authentication → unauthenticated preempt of the live user + cost abuse  ·  carry (slice-5 / Cloudflare Access)
`webrtc_server.py:108-129`,`76-85`,`138-140`. Unauth `/start`→offer binds `current["task"]` and cancels the old ("preempted") → kicks the real speaker, spins paid Flux/Fish/LLM. This is §2.8's tunnel/Access requirement = slice 5 (needs Тero's Cloudflare). Local-preempt hardening notable.

## MINOR

- **B14** `tools.py:144-150` dedup latch keys on tool NAME only (not args) → two same-name calls with different args in one turn: 2nd swallowed, returns 1st's result. FIX-W1 (cheap, add args to key).
- **B17** `state.py:218`+`kora.py:318-319` cancelled launched task never terminalizes → permanent CANCEL_REQUESTED limbo (terminalize only acts on RUNNING). carry.
- **B18** `state.py:344-347` corrupt/old-schema `state.json` swallowed (RUNNING task forgotten → R6 defeated; old-schema KeyError uncaught → build_host crash). carry.
- **B19** `state.py:244` liveness not gated on RUNNING while render/snapshot are → cancel-window inconsistency (liveness OK, snapshot awaiting=false). carry.
- **B20** `kora.py:206-216` `apply_event_to_store` drops SPEAK/critical for non-lifecycle events, diverging from `FakeKora.emit` "safety clone" the docstring claims is in sync. carry (latent).
- **B21** `kora.py:401`/`404`/`436` deny reason returns full absolute host paths to the injectable agent (username/layout disclosure oracle). carry.
- **B22** `kora.py:70-97` secret containment is a denylist → `prod.env`/`secrets.yaml`/`token.txt` read freely. carry (denylist incompleteness; B11 backstop applies).
- **B23** `strategy.py:87-90` `_advance` aborts failover (no next tier, no `_fail_all`, no alert) if `_set_active_if_available` returns None. carry (PLAUSIBLE).
- **B24** `webrtc_server.py:76-96` `current["task"]`+`bind_output` published OUTSIDE the cleanup try/finally → a raise in the setup window leaks the bind slot. carry.
- **B25** `webrtc_server.py:112-115` `/start` swallows all JSON parse errors → malformed body = empty handshake, not a diagnosable 400. carry.
- **B26** `config.py:106-107` `KORA_ENABLED=""` → False (asymmetric bool parsing vs other fields treating empty as unset). carry.
- **B27** `mock_llm.py:42-51` affirm/deny word-sets shadow submit/cancel routing (console/test path only). carry.
- **B28** `journal.py:65`/`app.py:151` TurnJournal fd never closed on live path (single fd, non-accumulating). carry.
- **B29** `webrtc_server.py:86`/`90` monitor task cancelled but never awaited on teardown (bounded 1:1, cosmetic). carry.

# Wave 2 hunt (2026-07-12) — cascade/money, arbiter, journal-wiring, persistence

## CRIT
- **B30** `services.py:80`/`breaker.py:48`/`strategy.py:95-98` — CostCap/breaker **never reset** (`reset()`/`reset_tier()` have zero non-test callers). One cap trip `hard_mute`s all paid tiers → every future turn `_fail_all` «связь с мозгом потеряна» **permanently** until process restart. Named `_per_day` but is per-process-lifetime. FIX-W2.
- **B31** `strategy.py:82`/`service_switcher.py:60` — `record_paid_attempt` fires ONLY in `_advance` (failover), never for the PRIMARY tier0 call → cost cap under-counts the majority of spend; a runaway loop on a *working* tier0 has zero cost protection. carry (fix needs a primary-call hook).
- **B13-cluster** (CONFIRMED, worse than described) `app.py:288` STT `on_end_of_turn` calls only `note_user_turn` — voice NEVER calls `journal.begin_turn`/`handlers.begin_turn`/`end_turn`/`check_grounding`. Consequences in the PRODUCTION voice path: (a) STATUS_WITHOUT_GROUNDING gate vacuous (§8 крит.5 protects nothing); (b) `record_tool_call` no-ops → empty tool audit; (c) **R1 dedup latch DEAD (`_current_turn_id` stays None) → a cascade retry can DOUBLE-EXECUTE a mutating tool incl. destructive `confirm_task`**; (d) zero turn records on disk; (e) `on_retry` journal no-op. ONE root cause (no begin_turn in voice). FIX-W3 (focused wiring wave).

## MAJOR
- **B32** `breaker.py:39,56`/`classify.py:37` — `Retry-After: 0` (or negative) → `mute_until==now` → tier not muted → `first_available` returns the just-failed tier → failover-to-self livelock on the dead tier, draining the cap. FIX-W2 (floor the mute).
- **B33** `classify.py:38-40`/`breaker.py:38-39` — every non-429/401/403 4xx (400/404/413, e.g. context-window-exceeded) → `ERROR` → mutes healthy tiers 60s → both tiers muted → «связь потеряна» on a benign deterministic bad request. FIX-W2 (don't mute the tier on a non-rate-limit client error).
- **B15** (CONFIRMED REAL, live bound-output path) `arbiter.py:86-88,104-113` — eager `_drain()` after every frame empties the queue, so an injected `TTSSpeakFrame` always hits an empty queue → survivor/drop-tail dead, `flush_dispatcher` never called live → Р-5 SPEAK-preemption defeated (SPEAK lands behind already-flushed dispatcher sentences). carry-W4.
- **B18** (CONFIRMED, HIGH) `state.py:344-354` — `_load` catches only `(JSONDecodeError, OSError)`; a valid-JSON-non-dict (`null`/`[]`) → `AttributeError`, an old-schema task/event → `KeyError`/`ValueError` → all UNCAUGHT → `build_host` crashes on EVERY boot until the file is deleted. FIX-W2.
- **B37** `confirm.py:127-129` — `_Staged(**persisted)` → `TypeError` on staged-schema drift → second `build_host` crash vector on the same restart. FIX-W2 (with B18).
- **B38** `kora.py:493` — `answers = {q["question"]: ...}` hard subscript (vs `.get` at :449) → `KeyError` on a malformed/hallucinated AskUserQuestion missing `"question"` → task FAILED AFTER the user's answer was consumed and discarded (slice-3 parking-lot path, now proven). FIX-W2.
- **B35** `context_guard.py:71-93`/`strategy.py:66` — `mark_aborted` scrubs already-COMMITTED tool messages if a non-fatal ErrorFrame lands in the window between `record_committed(N)` and the tool-loop's `start_generation(N+1)` → orphaned `tool_result`/missing `tool_use` → context corruption / provider 400. PLAUSIBLE, narrow. carry-W4.

## MINOR / MED
- **B36** `arbiter.py:69-76` — multiple pending SPEAKs prepend newest-first (LIFO) → older critical readback delayed behind newer. carry.
- **B39** `app.py:277,281`/`confirm.py:182` — `journal.alert()` called BARE (fsync can raise) in cascade `on_tail_tier`/`on_all_failed` + confirm self-attempt, unlike the B2-guarded monitor → an fsync failure there propagates into pipecat machinery. carry.
- **B40** `tools.py:173,216`/`journal.py:112` — dispatcher journal logs full user `text` (submit/answer_kora) + full `llm_output` in cleartext, contradicting kora.py's keys-only privacy posture → a spoken secret lands fsync'd. carry.
- **B41** `classify.py:76-79` — HTTP-date-form `Retry-After` → `float()` ValueError → silently degrades to 60s default (ignores provider's real window). carry (MINOR).

## Verdicts on carried leads
- **B23** (strategy `_advance` returns None): NOT A BUG — unreachable defensive code (`_advance` always passes a service in `self.services`; `_set_active_if_available` returns None only for a non-member). No fix.
- **B17** (CANCEL_REQUESTED never terminalizes): REAL but BENIGN/by-design — `has_active_task()` excludes CANCEL_REQUESTED so the slot is free and reclaimed on next submit; only cosmetic status/liveness residue. WON'T-FIX v1.
- **B12** (liveness decorative, no stale alert): REAL. carry-W5.

## Wave 2 — DONE (2026-07-12). FIXED red→green: **B18, B37, B38, B32, B33, B30** (6 bugs, +7 regression tests, suite 182→189).
Tests: `tests/test_bughunt_w2_persistence.py` (B18/B37/B38), `test_bughunt_w2_cascade.py` (B32/B33/B30).
Key fix notes: B30 = `CostCap.maybe_reset(now)` daily recovery + DROPPED the permanent `hard_mute`-on-cost-cap in strategy (that was the brick). B33 = new `ErrorKind.CLIENT` (breaker never mutes it, strategy fails the turn). Verdicts: B23 not-a-bug, B17 won't-fix (benign).
Deferred: B13-cluster→W3 (voice turn-lifecycle wiring); B15/B35/B36→W4 (arbiter/context frame-ordering); B31/B12/B39/B40/B41→W5.

---

## Wave 3 — DONE (2026-07-12). FIXED red→green: **B13(partial), B21, B39, B36** (4 bugs, +4 tests, suite 189→193).
Test: `tests/test_bughunt_w3.py`.
- **B13** — voice STT `on_end_of_turn` now calls `journal.begin_turn` + `handlers.begin_turn` → the R1 dedup latch is ARMED in voice (no more double-execute of mutating tools on a cascade retry) + tool audit records. REMAINING (carry): closing the turn with `check_grounding`/`end_turn` (capturing assistant text + turn-end in the frame flow) needs live-mic verification — B13-grounding→carry.
- **B21** — gate deny detail is category-only (`secret_path`/`outside_workspace`), no absolute path handed to the injectable agent via `permissionDecisionReason`.
- **B39** — `journal.alert()` is best-effort (OSError from fsync logged, not propagated) — all bare-alert callsites (cascade handlers, confirm) now safe.
- **B36** — arbiter SPEAK queue is FIFO among equal-priority speaks (older critical readback no longer delayed behind a newer one).
- **B24** — CARRIED (needs a setup-window-exception red test; not landed untested).
Deferred to W4/W5: B15/B35 (arbiter drain / context scrub), B31/B12/B40/B41/B24, B13-grounding.

---

## Wave 4 — DONE (2026-07-12). FIXED red→green: **B12, B41, B24** (3 bugs, +3 tests, suite 193→196).
Test: `tests/test_bughunt_w4.py`.
- **B12** — new `AlertKind.KORA_UNREACHABLE`; monitor emits it ONCE on the OK→stale/unreachable transition (Р-11 between-turns liveness no longer decorative).
- **B41** — `_retry_after_header` parses RFC-1123 HTTP-date form (`email.utils.parsedate_to_datetime`) → real seconds, not a silent 60s default.
- **B24** — run_session's setup-window ops (old.cancel + monitor spawn) moved inside the cleanup try → a raise there no longer leaks the bind slot / current publish / active_sessions entry.

## DESIGN-TENSION CARRIES (not fixed autonomously — need Тero + live mic):
- **B15** — arbiter eager per-frame `_drain` defeats SPEAK preemption. A genuine latency-vs-preemption tradeoff: drain-as-you-go gives low-latency streaming TTS; buffering so SPEAK can drop the dispatcher tail would regress that. Product decision + acoustic validation needed.
- **B35** — GenerationGuard `mark_aborted` keyed on `current_generation` can scrub committed tool messages in a narrow window; latent (a failing gen can't be superseded yet). Touching the delicate guard blind is riskier than the bug.
- **B13-grounding** — closing the voice turn (check_grounding + end_turn with captured assistant text) needs frame-timing work + live-mic verification.
- **B31** — primary tier0 paid call not cost-counted (only failover attempts are); needs a pipecat-internal primary-call hook.
- **B40** — dispatcher journal logs full user task text: WON'T-FIX (the task text is legitimately needed in the local audit; journal never leaves the Mac).

---

## Wave 1 — DONE (2026-07-12). FIXED red→green: **B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B8, B9, B14** (9 bugs, +9 regression tests, suite 173→182). B7 REJECTED by-design. B11 known-residual (no-exfil backstop).
Tests: `tests/test_bughunt_w1_state.py` (B1/B3/B14), `test_bughunt_w1_app_config.py` (B2/B4/B6/B9), `test_bughunt_w1_dispatch_webrtc.py` (B5/B8).
Carried to later waves: B10, B12, B13, B15, B16, B17-B29.
